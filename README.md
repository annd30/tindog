A tinder... but for your dog!

This is a project from the Udemy course "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.
This landing page was made using Bootstrap where we had to make a "Tinder" alike product but for dogs. 
Some things about Boostrap that I learned in this project:
-Navigation Bar
-Grid layout 
-Buttons
-Carousel
-Cards
